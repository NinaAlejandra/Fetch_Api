# Fetch api - Cards and StarWars

I have interacted with and leveraged various API properties to fetch and utilize data, while also styling and customizing the presentation of the obtained information.

## Usage

You can see my projects here:
https://starwars-characters-api.netlify.app/
https://drawing-cards.netlify.app/


### Star Wars Characters

By inputing a name of a Star Wars character you get details about them.

### Drawing Cards

Lets you view a different card by clicking the button. 

### Why?
I made these in a course where we needed to test out different API:s and reach different properties.
